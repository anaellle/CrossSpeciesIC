# Cross Species Integration and Comparison of single cell RNA sequencing data

This repository is the result of my 3 months internship at the EMBL-EBI. The first aim was to test if the integration tool expiMap was able to perform cross-species integration. Simulations not giving satisfactory results, it suggests that expiMap does not allows cross-species integration.
Moving on, the second purpose was to test SATURN, a promising cross-species integration tool.
To perform these integrations, I used scRNA-seq data from the primary motor cortex beteween human, mouse and fly.
